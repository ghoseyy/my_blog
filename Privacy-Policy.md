This Privacy Policy describes how **Bimql chhetry** (referred to as “**I**”, “**me**”, or “**my**”) collects, uses, and shares information when you use my websites, apps, games, and other online services (collectively, the “services”).

By using the services, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

---

## 1. Information I collect

I may collect both **personal information** and **non‑personal information** when you use the services.

**Personal information** means information that can be used to identify you, such as your name, email address, phone number, or certain device identifiers when they are linked to you.

**Non‑personal information** means information that cannot reasonably be used to identify you on its own, such as device model, app version, general location (city or country), or aggregated usage statistics.

### 1.1 Information you provide

I collect information that you voluntarily provide, including:

- **Contact details** – such as your name, email address, or phone number when you contact me or sign up for an account (if applicable).  
- **Account details** – such as username, profile photo, and basic profile information, if the service offers accounts.  
- **Content** – such as messages, comments, posts, photos, and any other content you create or upload using the services.  
- **Support requests** – information you provide when you ask for help, including screenshots, logs you send, and any other details you choose to share.

### 1.2 Information collected automatically

When you use the services, some information is collected automatically, for example:

- **Device information** – device type, operating system and version, language, time zone, and app or browser version.  
- **Usage information** – pages or screens viewed, features used, navigation paths, time spent, dates and times of use.  
- **Log data** – IP address, error logs, crash reports, performance data, and diagnostic information.  

This information may be collected using cookies, local storage, SDKs, or similar technologies, depending on the platform.

### 1.3 Information from your device (with permission)

Some features may request access to additional information from your device, such as:

- Contacts (to help you find friends or share content).  
- Camera, photos, or files (to allow you to capture or upload content).  
- Microphone (for audio features).  
- Location data (approximate or precise) for location‑based features.  

Access to these is based on your device or browser permissions. You can deny or revoke permissions at any time in your device settings, but some features may not work without them.

### 1.4 Information from third‑party services

If you choose to sign in or connect through a third‑party service (for example, a social login or platform account), that service may share certain information with me (such as your name, email, profile picture, or an identifier), according to their own privacy policy and your settings.

### 2.1 To provide and maintain the services

- To operate the apps, games, and websites you use.  
- To create and manage accounts or profiles, if applicable.  
- To store and display the content you create or share.  
- To process in‑app actions or purchases through third‑party stores (where applicable).

### 2.2 To communicate with you

- To send you important notices about changes, security alerts, or technical issues.  
- To send optional updates, tips, or announcements about new features, if you choose to receive them.

### 2.3 To improve the services

## 3. How I share your information

I do **not** sell your personal information.

I may share information in these situations:

### 3.1 With other users

Depending on how you use the services and your settings, certain information may be visible to other users, such as:

- Your name, username, and profile photo.  
- Content you choose to post publicly (such as comments, posts, scores, or reviews).  

### 3.2 With service providers

I may share information with third‑party service providers who help me operate and improve the services, such as:

- Hosting and cloud storage providers.  
- Analytics and crash reporting tools.  
- Email or notification services.  
- Payment processors (for in‑app or online purchases, where applicable).

These providers process information on my behalf and are not allowed to use it for their own purposes outside what is necessary to provide their services.

### 3.3 For legal and safety reasons

I may access, preserve, and disclose information if I believe in good faith that it is reasonably necessary to:

- Comply with laws, legal processes, or government requests.  
- Enforce my terms or investigate potential violations.  
- Detect, prevent, or address fraud, security, or technical issues.  
- Protect my rights, property, or safety, or that of users or the public.

### 3.4 Business changes

If I ever transfer or substantially change my personal business (for example, by selling or transferring an app to another individual or company), your information may be transferred to the new owner, who must continue to handle it in a way that is consistent with this Privacy Policy or notify you of changes.

## 4. Data security

I use reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your information from unauthorized access, loss, or misuse, including:

- Using secure connections (HTTPS) where possible.  
- Limiting access to personal data to only what is necessary.  
- Regularly updating software and infrastructure.

However, no method of transmission or storage is completely secure, and I cannot guarantee absolute security.

---

## 5. Data retention

I keep your information only for as long as necessary for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, including:

- As long as you maintain an account or actively use the services.  
- For as long as needed to comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, or enforce agreements.  

When information is no longer needed, I will delete or anonymize it within a reasonable time, subject to backup and archival limitations.

Depending on your location and applicable law, you may have the following rights over your personal information:

- **Access** – You can request a copy of the personal information I hold about you.

To exercise these rights, please contact me using the details in the **Contact** section below. I may ask you to verify your identity before responding to certain requests.

You can also:

- Change app or browser permissions (for example, location, contacts, camera).  
- Disable cookies in your browser (for web services), though some features may not work properly.

## 7. Third‑party services and links

The services may contain links to third‑party websites, apps, or services that I do not own or control, and may integrate third‑party SDKs or tools.

- Their own privacy policies govern how they collect and use information.  
- I am not responsible for the content or privacy practices of those third parties.  

You should review the privacy policies of any third‑party services you use.

## 8. Children’s privacy

The services are not intended for children where they are not legally allowed to use them without parental consent (for example, children under 13 or under the minimum age required by your local laws).

I do not knowingly collect personal information from children without appropriate consent. If you believe a child has provided me with personal information, please contact me so I can delete it.

## 9. International users

Your information may be processed and stored in countries other than your own. Data protection laws may differ from those in your country, but I will take reasonable steps to protect your information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

---

## 10. Changes to this Privacy Policy

I may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When I do, I will update the “Last updated” date at the top of this page.

If changes are material, I may provide additional notice (for example, in the app or on the website). Your continued use of the services after the changes take effect means you accept the updated Privacy Policy.
