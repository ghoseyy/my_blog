Hello again, it's me, bimql.pdf. You may know me as the person who created this website to post technical content. Now, it seems like AI might replace me with higher-quality content. Regardless, I will continue to write my genuine content.

In discussions about social media, I often hear people in my circles say that it kills our creativity or wastes our time. I don't entirely agree. There are aspects of social media that can provide us with quality content and discussions.

Ultimately, it's up to you how you use your time on social media. I'm here to guide my readers towards platforms and portals where they can find valuable information and discussions. I will provide a list shortly.

In this section, I will address a few topics that may be of interest to both local and international readers.

### Facebook Group: [Ask Buddie](https://www.facebook.com/groups/askbuddie/)

This is a Facebook group dedicated to discussing IT and tech-related content. Here, you can share your opinions, ask questions, or conduct surveys. With nearly 30k members and over 500 users active at any given time, you can quickly get answers to your problems or queries.

### Reddit [r/technepal](https://www.reddit.com/r/technepal/)

The next one is r/technepal, which has nearly 19k tech-savvy people from Nepal who ask and solve their tech-related problems. I have been using this group for a long time, asking and providing solutions countless times with genuine answers. If you're a tech enthusiast looking to gather information and engage in discussions, this group is an excellent option for you.

This is also a community for all Nepali tech enthusiasts to come together and discuss everything tech-related. Discussions range from new and old technologies to pricing and availability in the Nepali market and beyond.

### The Hacker News

Hacker News is a social news website that concentrates on computer science and entrepreneurship. It is managed by the investment fund and startup incubator, Y Combinator. In general, the content that can be submitted is described as "anything that satisfies one's intellectual curiosity."

This site is a daily go-to for me. The '/best' category consistently provides well-chosen content. You can access it here: [Besthackernews](https://news.ycombinator.com/best).

### Opportunities on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/hp/)

Now we're shifting to talk about LinkedIn. This ain't your average social media platform - it's a goldmine for anyone on the hunt for a job.

LinkedIn is more than just a place to show off your professional headshot and fancy job titles. It's a networking hub where you can connect with professionals in your field, keep up with industry trends, and, most importantly, discover job opportunities.

Whether you're a fresh grad looking to land your first gig or an experienced professional aiming for a career shift, LinkedIn has got you covered. You'll find vacancies from companies of all sizes and sectors. And the best part? You can apply directly through the platform.

So, don't just scroll aimlessly through your LinkedIn feed. Use it to your advantage, and who knows? You might just land your dream job. Good luck!

### Use social media to boost your personal or professional image.

Effectively utilizing social media platforms can significantly enhance your personal or professional presence. Sharing relevant and engaging content, connecting with your audience, and promoting your achievements or skills can help build a robust online persona or brand, opening up new opportunities and connections.

By regularly using popular social platforms like Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube, you can reach a wider audience. The key is to be consistent and regularly push content while engaging with your audience.

There are various ways to connect with your audience, such as using graphics, images, photos, articles, and videos. For instance, you can create business graphics with simple tools like [canva.com](http://canva.com/) for free. For more complex designs, Adobe software is an excellent alternative. For images, you can use AI tools or take pictures yourself. The same applies to videos and articles. These platforms and tools can be leveraged to enhance your content on social media.

### Bonus Tip

Somehow, I've acquired a few extra talents to show off. Not many, but a few, and one of them is my photography skills, for which I've gained recognition through social media. So, social media has power, yes...

Whether you're a regular or new user, you might find this text monotonous. However, I have something for you. You can now enjoy some cool photos that I showcase on my [pexels.com](https://www.pexels.com/@bimal-chhetry-162267621/) page. I've sold some of these photos and generated a few dollars. You can check this out and have fun. Yes, you can use my photos for educational purposes. Please do not misuse them or attempt to sell them. I hold the copyright, so you might get in trouble if found doing so.
